Escape Room - Lab Course SS2021
===============================

 > Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. - Arthur C. Clarke

 In this lab course you will extend the (fully automated) on-campus Area-079 escape room. The escape room is a game where a team of players is locked in the room and has to solve puzzles to escape the room in a limited timeframe.

 In this lab course we will build fully connected outdoor puzzle. This will be done in cooperation with Frexit, the Freiburg Exit Game Company, and the Sportclub Freiburg, Freiburg's local football club.

 Conceptualize and build a networked and embedded system which will automate an Escape Room user experience. You will team up with 2-5 students and implement your system. We encourage you to participate in the Bosch Sensor IoT challenge with your project.

 Your task will be to team up with fellow students, build a gadget which implements a puzzle and integrate it into the overall flow of the game. This will teach you the basic of ubiquituous computing, which is computing which is hidden in the environment, where each device is connected to each other and in which user intention is estimated with the help of sensors (called Context Recognition). Some also call this the Internet of Things.

 Philipp Wirthgen will teach about game design, and Philipp Scholl will help you in building the embedded systems and implementing your puzzles. Puzzle Ideas can be gathered from literature on building escape rooms [@Nicholson, @Shakeri_2017, @Ross_2020], while interaction ideas can be gathered from the [CHI conference](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/chi/index.html), [Ubicomp/ISWC](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/huc/index.html) and [IMWUT journal](https://imwut.acm.org).

Teaching Goals
--------------

 The participants learn…

 … to implement complex human-computer interaction\
 … to utilize networked embedded systems\
 … to integrate sensors into novel application\
 … to build embedded systems in a team and integrate this in a larger system

Participants and Prerequisites
------------------------------

 This lab course is open for all study programs of the technical faculty at the university of Freiburg. Electronic prototyping and/or programming skills are required. The lab course is worth 6 ECTS, and is roughly equivalent to 120-180 working hours, i.e. 8-12 work hours per week. The course is limited to a maximum of 20 participants, and this term to groups of three people.

Tutors and Communication
------------------------

 reach out to us via email:

  - Philipp M. Scholl <pscholl@tf.uni-freiburg.de>
  - Philipp Wirthgen <philipp.wirthgen@frexit.de>

 TODO we will also communicate via BBB, discord or matrix
 TODO every project needs to register on the github organization for the project1

Teaching Plan
-------------

 We will hold 14 session. The first four ones are on the basics of escape room game design, and on ubiquituous computing. Afterwards you will be put into groups and have time to select and refine puzzle ideas. We will discuss in the group and figure out how to merge them in the overall flow of the game. The remaining session will be on basic micro-controller programming and using git. After that we weill host weekly trial runs of the puzzle with more and more refined mock-ups. This will allow everyone to stay up-to-date with the latest developments and assures that there will be a final game with working puzzles.
